A simple demo/example for 6.170 Project 3, Fall 2014.

Use along with the notes found here:
https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa14/6.170/courseMaterial/topics/topic3/readings/NuggetonAPIs/NuggetonAPIs.pdf

This repo contains an API and front-end that allows users to store documents or "secrets" that no one else can see or modify. Obviously, we expect your project 3's to be more complicated, but hopefully this is gives a good example for how to get started.

Each API function is documented above its corresponding router declaration. For the front-end, handlebars is used. We recommend but do not require a templating engine so that you don't have to deal with the low-level details of inserting HTML into your single-page frontend. For more information about Handlebars, see the templates/ directory or visit their website.
